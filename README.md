# PROJECTS

## Overview

This repository contains code projects with detailed explanations and supporting diagrams. The documentation and diagrams help users understand the code structure, workflow, and output. Key explanations are supplemented by diagrams found in the included PDFs: `info.pdf` and `outputs.pdf`.

## Code Explanation

- The core logic is implemented in the `src/` directory.
- Each module/file is documented with comments for better understanding.
- The workflow and architecture are visually represented in the diagrams found in `info.pdf`.
- Example outputs and their explanations are included in `outputs.pdf`.

### Example Workflow (as per info.pdf)

<!-- If you extract images from info.pdf, embed them like this: -->
<!-- ![Architecture Diagram](docs/architecture-diagram.png) -->

1. **Initialization:** The program starts by initializing key parameters and modules.
2. **Execution:** The main process runs according to the logic described in the source files.
3. **Output Generation:** Results are produced and visualized as shown in the diagrams in `outputs.pdf`.

### Example Output (as per outputs.pdf)

- The output diagrams illustrate how data flows through the program and what the expected results are for sample inputs.

## Diagrams

- **Architecture and Workflow:**  
  Refer to [`info.pdf`](./info.pdf) for system architecture, module relationships, and workflow diagrams.

- **Output and Data Flow:**  
  Refer to [`outputs.pdf`](./outputs.pdf) for diagrams showing output formats, data flow, and sample results.

> **Tip:** To view diagrams inline, you may extract images from the PDFs and embed them in this README using the Markdown `![]()` syntax.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/SANGEETH-KUMAR07/PROJECTS.git
   cd PROJECTS
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   # Example for Python projects
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the main program:**
   ```sh
   # Adjust this command as per your entry script
   python src/main.py
   ```

4. **Explore diagrams:**  
   Open `info.pdf` and `outputs.pdf` for visual references to the codebase and outputs.
